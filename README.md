This project involves predicting whether a candy has chocolate or not based on consumers responses. 
The workflow includes importing necessary packages, data exploration, data visualization, model training, and evaluation. 
The logistic regression algorithm was used due to the binary nature of the target variable (0,1). 
At the initial stage, all necessary packages were imported: Numpy: for numerical operations, Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis, and Matplotlib and Seaborn: for data visualization.
Data was imported and explored. Data exploration included presenting the data shape, information, columns, and descriptive statistics to understand the dataset's structure and 
characteristics. Correlation Analysis were created to show the correlation between the independent variables and the dependent variable (if the candy has chocolate or not). 
The Algorithm used for model selection was the Logistic regression, which was chosen as the target variable is binary (0 for not chocolate, 1 for chocolate). 
The model was validated using the following metrics:
•	Accuracy Score
•	F1 Score
•	Recall Score
•	Precision Score
•	Confusion Matrix
Classification Report and Interpretation
Precision Scores:
•	Class 0 (Not chocolate): The precision score for class 0 was 0.83. This means that out of all the chocolates the model predicted as Not Chocolate, 83% were actually Not Chocolate. 
In other words, 17% of the chocolates predicted as Not Chocolate were incorrectly classified and are actually Chocolate.
•	Class 1 (Chocolate): The precision score for class 1 was 1.00. This implies that out of all the candies the model predicted as Chocolate, 100% were correctly classified as Chocolate.
The model did not make any false positive errors for predicting candies as Chocolate.
F1 Scores:
•	Class 0 (Not Chocolate): The F1 score for class 0 was 0.91, indicating that the model performs very well when predicting candies that are Not Chocolate. 
A high F1 score suggests that the model accurately identifies most of the candies that are Not Chocolate, balancing precision and recall effectively.
•	Class 1 (Chocolate): The F1 score for class 1 was 0.83. While lower than the F1 score for class 0, it still indicates good performance in predicting candies that are Chocolate. 
The lower F1 score suggests that the model might miss some actual candies (lower recall) or mistakenly classify some non-candies as Chocolate (lower precision).
Accuracy:
•	The model achieved an accuracy score of 0.88, suggesting that it generally performs well, correctly identifying candies as Chocolate or Not Chocolate in most cases.
Conclusion
•	Strong Performance for Class 0 (Not Chocolate): With a high precision score of 0.83 and an F1 score of 0.91, the model is strong at identifying candies that are Not Chocolate.
•	Reliable for Class 1 (Chocolate): The precision score of 1.00 for class 1 indicates that the model is very reliable when predicting that a candy is Chocolate. 
However, the F1 score of 0.83 suggests that there is room for improvement in balancing precision and recall for this class.
•	Overall Accuracy: An accuracy score of 0.88 indicates that the model performs well in most cases. However, other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, 
and the confusion matrix should also be considered to ensure the model performs well across different scenarios, 
especially if there is a class imbalance or if certain types of errors are more critical than others.
